        <h1>James Moorhouse - The Software Engineer</h1>
        <p>Wow, you made it as far as the "about me" page, I'm impressed ;) Well, here goes...</p>
        <p>
            Since around age 13, I've been toying with computers, predominantly web based tech. From here, I begun creating
            websites for local businesses, went to University for a degree in Computer Science and then landed myself various
            roles as a Software Engineer
        </p>
        <p>
            Software wise, my passion lies in creating simple, easy to read and understand code with a mind for performance.
            I've worked on some truly huge scale apps before (200+ transactions per second) as well as smaller apps which needed
            to be completed on a budget.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm much more of a team player than I am a lone wolf. Give me code review and mentoring less senior staff over
            hacking away on my own for a month. I've worked with Architects, Testers, Business Analysts and other Software Engineers
            to lead the technical delivery of business critical projects.
        </p>
