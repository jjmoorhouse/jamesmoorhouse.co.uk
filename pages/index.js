            <p>
                An experienced full stack developer with both team and project leadership experience. My recent work has
                been focused on the frontend, using React, although Iâ€™m currently looking to return to a full stack
                role. I have a strong background across the stack including knowledge of devops tools such as AWS and
                chef. As a developer I take pride in delivering well tested, performant code which is easy to read and
                maintain.
