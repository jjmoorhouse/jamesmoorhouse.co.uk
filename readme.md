If you're reading this, you're probably here to inspect the quality of the code.

Assuming that's the case, I'd just like to get one very important fact out of the way

**The code and tech used in this repository is a massive overkill for the 
purposes of rendering  a few static-ish web pages**
 
 The reason I've gone a bit overboard is simply so that I can use this repository 
 as a code sample for the type of code I would write, were I to be writing 
 scalable production ready applications as part of a large team.
